## 🧾 **Project Description (Use in LinkedIn, GitHub, Resume)**

> I created my first AI-powered agent called **"Gym Appointment Setter – AI Agent"** that automates gym slot bookings using natural language processing.
> The agent interacts with users via a simple chat interface, understands their preferred time, and confirms available slots.
> It uses the **OpenAI API** for conversation logic and can be integrated into any fitness app, website, or chatbot system.
> The goal was to combine **React**, **Node.js**, and **OpenAI GPT-3.5 API** to build a functional, real-world AI use case that improves user experience and reduces human effort in appointment scheduling.
